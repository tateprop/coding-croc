# coding-croc
This repo is for all the projects i create while still learning - basically nooby shiz

Lessons learned:
From Coding is easy:
1 - My JS is terrible in here it was written at a time when i didnt understand much.
2 - I did desktop first development then added modile. I know this is not the convention but it felt very natural. I'll have to get used to the correct way.
3 - My CSS is not all that clean there's parts i could have reused - re-use classes
4 - That shadow effect adds a LOT and a consistant colour pallete is pretty nice too.

From rock paper scissors:
1 - My javascript has gotten a bit better
2 - this was not that hard which is reassuring
3 - I did mobile first development and it was easier i think.
