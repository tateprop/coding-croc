Chess is a hard game to program
I'll be recoding it untill i am good

Im moving on fromm attempt 2 beacuse my code is structured badly and i want the code to make more sense
Im axing attempt 3 i hate everthing and can barely think moving on to attempt 4.
4 - I went all the way with OOP and i absolutely hate it. Code that i have written in 100 lines is now 300 lines
I think the layout is a bit nicer and more readable?
But honestly im not even sure it is.
Theres short code and readible code I've always done short - i guess thats wrong in a collaberative env. But the transition is hard.
I need to get to the bottom of what elegant code is supposed to look like - I think ill pause until i have a better idea
