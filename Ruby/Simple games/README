Ok i will be writing tic tac toe until i am good

1 - i am very bad - code is junk and horid im stopping here to look at other peopeles code and then ill start again  
2 - Ok this one is a lot nicer adn much less googling, tommorow i will make again with no google + niver code
3 - i generated the board manually this time and i didnt have to google anything and it tooke me less time to complete

i still dont think my code is remotely pretty. I guess that comes with time but im incredibly bored of Tic Tac Toe so im moving on

Done Mastermind i banged this out fairly quickly but im not going to implement all thge extra stuff bcos i know i can easily and dont want to waste time on boring stuff
